Ping-Pong
Create a web application that takes a number from a user and returns a range of numbers from 1 to the chosen number with the following exceptions:

Numbers divisible by 3 are replaced with "ping"
Numbers divisible by 5 are replaced with "pong"
Numbers divisible by 15 are replaced with "ping-pong"
A user should be able to enter a new number and see new results over and over again.

Break the program down into simple, individual behaviors with input/output examples. Begin with the simplest possible behavior. List these behaviors (also known as "specs" or "specifications") in the project's README.md file.

Business logic: The code responsible for handling the evaluation and manipulation of data; does not require any user interface.

User interface logic: The code responsible for the interaction between the user and the application; handles tasks such as event listening, user input forms, DOM manipulation, display and styling. We have not covered how to write the actual code for this yet; don't worry!
